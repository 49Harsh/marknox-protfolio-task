Subject: React Portfolio Project 
Dear Sir,
I'm reaching out to share a recent project that demonstrates my expertise in modern web development. My interactive portfolio website showcases the following:
Key Features:

Responsive design using React.js and Tailwind CSS
Smooth animations with GSAP and Framer Motion
Docker integration for easy deployment
SEO and accessibility optimizations

Technical Highlights:

Frontend: React.js with component-based architecture
Styling: Tailwind CSS for efficient, utility-first approach
Animations: GSAP for scroll effects, Framer Motion for component animations
Containerization: Docker with custom setup
Development: VS Code with Remote Containers

The project includes a responsive header, dynamic home section, about me page, portfolio showcase,  all designed with modern UI/UX principles.

Responsive and accessible web design

Thank you for your consideration.
Best regards, Harsh yadav




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
